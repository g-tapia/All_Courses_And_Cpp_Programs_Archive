# Over-350-Programs-that-I-studied

So this repository contains a link to most of the programs that I studied over the years with a lot of notes written by me. There are quite a few more but I used a different IDE for the other programs so I never got the chance to save them. I lost some applications when my other computer messed up.


The link below takes you to my repl account. You can navigate yourself through the programs once you click on the link. Since you are clicking on the link, you are not able to see how I have everything organized according to topics and language.

Side Notes:

-Roughly 300 programs are from a C++ book that I spent studying for a few months (multiple hours a day). Every program in that C++ book I re-typed myself (not copied and pasted), added additional functionalities, and wrote a lot of notes whenever I needed to understand something. I also did most of the mystery programs in the book, and found creative ways to add all of the library functions to those same programs. 

Just to give you an idea on my studying habits, If I encountered a concept that I did not understand, I would open a container on repl, write a program on it after doing research, add notes, and added a title that corresponded to the chapter that I was on.


-Some labs contained in there are from my previous courses too.

-All the other languages, I copied and pasted most of them from a different IDE because I just wanted to save them
