# -350-Programs-that-I-studied- (When I say that there is over 350 programs here, I mean it. I counted them all. You should be able to navigate through all of them)

So this repository contains a link to all the programs that I stuided over the years.

https://replit.com/@gtapia17?path=folder/Programming%20applications%2C%20notes%2C%20and%20studied%20programs

The link takes you to my repl account. I was not able to transfer all those programs here because repl doesn't have that functionality. It would take me quite a few days to transfer all of them one by one, so instead, I will show screenshots, and you can navigate yourself through the link.

Side Notes:

-Roughly 300 programs are from a C++ book that I spent studying for a few months. Every program in that book, I re-wrote myself to understand how they worked (Not copy, and pasted), and wrote notes if I needed too. I also did most of the mystery programs, and added a bunch of different functionalities to most of those programs. I wanted to use all the functions that were mentioned in each section so that I can understand how everything worked.

-My brother would constantly tell me that I had no life, and I agreed

-Some labs are contained in there from my previous courses too.

-All the other languages, I copied and pasted most of them from a different IDE because I just wanted to save them
