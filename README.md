# Over-350-Programs-that-I-studied

So this repository contains a link to most of the programs that I studied over the years with a lot of notes written by me. There are quite a few more but I used a different IDE for the other programs so I never got the chance to save them. I lost some when my other computer messed up.


The link takes you to my repl account. You can navigate yourself through the programs once you click on the link.

Side Notes:

-Roughly 300 programs are from a C++ book that I spent studying for a few months (multiple hours a day). Every program in that book, I re-typed myself with notes, added additional functionalities to most of the programs, in order to understand how they work (Not copy, and pasted), and wrote notes if I needed too. I also did most of the mystery programs. I used all the functions that were mentioned in each section so that I can understand how everything worked.


-Some labs contained in there are from my previous courses too.

-All the other languages, I copied and pasted most of them from a different IDE because I just wanted to save them
