# Over-350-Programs-that-I-studied

So this repository contains a link to most of the programs that I studied over the years with a lot of notes written by me. There are quite a few more but I used a different IDE for the other programs so I never got the chance to save them. I lost some applications when my other computer messed up.


The link below takes you to my repl account. You can navigate yourself through the programs once you click on the link. Since you are clicking on the link, you are not able to see how I have everything organized according to topics and language (I put some sample pictures at the bottom of this readme).

Side note:
I noticed that replit changed the way you view public links. Before, you were able to see the files/code right away, now you have to do the following to see the code:

then click on the file you want to view. P.s. The captcha is annoying.


Side Note:

-Roughly 300 programs are from a C++ (Chapters 1-14) book that I spent studying for a few months (multiple hours a day). Every program in that C++ book I re-typed myself (not copied and pasted), added additional functionalities, and wrote a lot of notes whenever I needed to understand something. I also did most of the mystery programs in the book, and found creative ways to add all of the library functions to those same programs. 

Just to give you an idea on my studying habits, If I encountered a concept that I did not understand, I would open a container on replit, write a program on it after doing research, add notes, and added a title that corresponded to the chapter that I was on.


-Some labs contained in there are from my previous courses too.

-All the other languages, I copied and pasted some of them from a different IDE because I just wanted to save them.
