# All Course Work
This repository serves as an archive of various programs (300 of which are C++) and notes I've accumulated through years of study. 

To browse through my collection, simply follow the [Replit link](https://replit.com/@gtapia17?path=folder/Programming%20applications%2C%20notes%2C%20and%20studied%20programs). Once there, you can freely navigate through different topics and languages. Prior to clicking the link, I suggest reading the note below. 

**Note**: Replit recently altered how public links are displayed. Previously, code files were immediately visible, but now you must perform the following steps to access the code:

1. Click on 'Show Files'

   <pre>

   </pre>

2. Select the file you wish to view (please note that you may encounter a captcha).

Additionally, due to the nature of hyperlinks, you might miss the structured organization of content into different topics and languages - a glimpse of which can be seen in the sample images at the end of this README. 

## Summary

In particular, I've thoroughly studied a C++ book (Chapters 1-14), from which about 300 programs are derived. Each one of these programs has been typed out manually by me, supplemented with additional functionalities and extensive notes for better understanding. I've also solved most of the mystery programs from the book, incorporating all library functions into these programs.

A testament to my diligent studying habits - if I encountered a difficult concept, I would create a new Replit container, research the concept, write a program to help me apply the concept, add insightful notes, and finally title the program appropriately.

The repository also houses labs from my past courses. 

For the sake of convenience, some code snippets from other languages have been copied from different IDEs and pasted into this repository.

The images below offer a peek into the contents of my Replit account: notes and numerous programs, all aiming to reinforce fundamental concepts.
